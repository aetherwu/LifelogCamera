# LifelogCamera

This app takes photos every 30s using the back camera. You can tap anywhere on the screen to take an extra one.
Ideally, you can bond your iPhone as a lifelog device using a headband or chest band.

- If you don't need 'send to the server' function, comment it in ViewController.m
- If you need 'send to the server' funtion, please modify YOURDOMAIN in the ViewControlloer.m to your server, and place camera.php on your server.
- Use a fisheye or wide angle lens to get a wider view.
- Use pic.php to browse uploaded photos in your browser.
